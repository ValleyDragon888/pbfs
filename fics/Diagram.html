    <h1>REUBENISH</h1>
    <p>Pages.....pages....ink.....pen.....him......</p>
    <p>Reubenish looked up from his PD book to see him. Blonde hair falling into his pale face. His blue eyes darting over the page, brows furrowing in interest. Ouen. Ouen jhons. Reubenish knew it wasn't right, yet he couldn't cage the butterflies now bouncing off the walls of his stomach. Ouen looks up. Meeting his gaze with a slight smile. God, that smile. Reubenishs traitorus mouth twitched up at the corners. Shit. Got to play it off, so he only smiled wider at Ouen. Emersaughyer snickered beside him, dragging Reubenishs attention away from the blonde angel in front of him. Emersaughyer points at a word. Penis. Still snickering as Reubenish realises what lesson he's in. Sex education. And he just smiled at the boy of his wet dreams. SEX EDUCATION. Reubenish dips his head, pretending to laugh along with Emersaughyers childish humour when he's blushing brighter than ouen jhons beautiful, round, sparkling, b..... "Boobies" Emersaughyer cracks up, howling with laughter and making curvy cooper (cough cough) Mr cooper scowl in their direction. "Whos being a silly sausage" Curvy Cooper scolds in a playful an oddly, scratch that, just plain creepy way, causing emersaughyer to slam his tiny fist on the desk, looking up to Reubenish for approval. Reubenish buries his face in his hands, groaning at Emersaughyers obvious lack of sanity, then peeking through his fingers at Ouen, who is quietly reciting his Mongolian throat singing. Perfect angle for Reubenish to watch. Head in hands and his eyes practically making little love hearts. A cough comes from the other side of the classroom, and Reubenishs looks over to see brown eyes narrowed suspiciously at him. Shit she caught on. Vas arton caught on. Reubenish feet a rush of panic as vas' narrowed eyes turn into a storm just waiting to brew and a whole heap of trouble coming his way. Maths was going to be hell.</p>
    <h1>EMERSAUGHER</h1>
    <p>Emersaughyer practically threw his pencil case into his bag as curvy cooper finally let them all pack away for the end of the class. Reubenish, with his big dark brown eyes, is scanning the room his usually tanned skin now as pale as if he had seen the ghost of Christmas past. Emersaughyer couldn't tell the direction Reubenishs eyes were going. Darting towards ouen, vas and him.... Reubenish was looking at him. He internally squealed like a firework of Bonfire Night. This made his day. He felt like Ken in the Barbie movie 'Barbie had a great day every day. ken only had a great day if Barbie looked at him.' Emersaughyer had to hold in his giggle. He'd have to wait until he got home to kick his feet and giggle at a photo of Reubenish. He walked out of the classroom with a bounce in his step as Reubenish walked in between him and Ouen. He chose to walk next to Emersaughyer. Reubenish was sooo in love with him. Ewando was waiting outside the classroom, looking disgusted at the people coming out. "So many white people," Ewando muttered grumpily as he joined the line of them walking towards their bin. Ewandos' eyes kept darting between him, and Reubenish and Emersaughyer felt a surge of jealousy. How dare somebody look at his man like that. Who did Ewando think he was? Emersaughyer grits his teeth, holding back the urge to rip Ewandos eyes out for even daring to look in Reubenishs direction. His eyes were drawn away from the dark eyed beauty before him to a boyfriend and girlfriend. A particularly cute couple. His mind raced with thoughts on how he could slide right into the middle of that before he remembered that he was meant to be staying loyal to his crush on reubenish. Turning his attention back to reubenish, the emersaughyer tried to get his traitorus mind to focus on the 'love of his life'. He turned back to his friends, watching as they dug a hole in the dirt. "We should put Ewando in it" was the immidiate suggestion that came to emersaughyers mind, earning an onslaught of laughter apart from Ewando who looked like he was still trying to figure out how that was funny. Emersaughyer immediately searched for Reubenishs approval only to find his attention fixated on Ouen. Emersaughyer wanted to shrivel up and live in a gutter with the rats for the rest of his life. Reubenish wasn't looking back at him. His brown eyes latched onto Ouen laughing with pig snorts. And he was a pig. Emersaughyer thought as his mind raced with ways for Reubenish to notice him in the way he wanted. Baddie Makeup? No. New hairstyle? Maybe. He looked towards Ouen, who wasn't looking at Reubenish but instead avoiding Emersaughyers' gaze at all costs.... maybe reubenish was in love with Ouen but was Ouen in love with him back.....</p>
    <h1>OUEN</h1>
    <p>The walk to maths was gruelling, like walking to prison as a criminal however his feet were tied, his mouth was taped shut, he'd just been through a pepper grinder and he'd already been through double physics today. He opened the door to Dr Linlon already lecturing the class on top gun points. Really, top gun points were rather fun. However, Ouen was not in the top 10 students, so he was not pleased with the whole system. In his opinion, the system was rigged purely because he did not get an honourable mention in the last lesson. He glanced towards emersaughyer, who, for the first time, had his grey eyes focused on Ouen. Everything exploded at once, the lights in the maths corridor went fuzzy, the colours swirling around him as emersaughyer met his gaze. He felt so light. Like he could just fly away, ascend into heaven, and Emersaughyer would be right there to guide him. The wall met his face. Ouen cursed silently as he stumbled backwards. Fucking walls in his fucking way. He looked around to see people laughing hysterically at him...Well not hysterically or infact laughing that was all his imagination but he needed to be able to excuse his embarrassment. He walked into the maths classroom with his head down, picking up the wrong red folder and only noticing when he got to his desk meaning he had to walk the entire 10 metres back to the box. What a day this was. He sat down with the right folder and managed to get across the classroom without any collisions with walls. Emersaughyer was waiting at his desk for him and he could feel the butterflies getting giddy as Emersaughyer finally turned to him and started to flirt? "Hey" he murmured, running a hand through his hair whilst glancing at Ouen in a way that made his knees weak. The feeling quickly stopped when emersaughyer glanced towards Reubenish who looked like he wanted to die under Vas' scrutiny. Ouen looked back to see Emersaughyer gazing at him with sparkling grey eyes and his head resting on his hand. Emersaughyers other hand snaked over as he laughed at another ones of Ewandos racist jokes, resting on Ouens trembling hand. God this must be one of the best days of his life, probably even better than the time he beat Lukasmitchen on the amount of hours he was on rednote and got bragging rights for a whole day until lukasmitchen spent a whole day on rednote, missing dinner because he was sat on the toilet watching a man break his arm from trying to break ziplocs. Ouens gaze flicked back down as Emersaughyers hand squeezed his tightly and gazed into ouens eyes. New statement: this was going to be even better than his wedding day. Emersaughyer had already stole his heart and locked it away in a golden cage that now only he could open and with just a flick of his fingers Ouen would have knelt down before Emersaughyer or jumped off a cliff for him. He wasn't even annoyed wuth the fact that his whole life now revolved around a short man with wondering eyes but his eyes were so beautiful, so captivating. Ouen felt like the moon orbiting Earth, constantly watching this beautiful (short) boy take his whole attention.</p>
    <h1>REUBENISH</h1>
    <p>This was hell. One side of him he had Vas. On the other side, he had lellenna both had decided they were going to be the little shits they were, and they were doing it annoyingly well. He tried to block them out, focusing on maths and answering these stupid questions. Vas leaned over "its wrong," she blurted out bluntly. Lellenna laughed "is that because Ouen isn't sucking on your co-," Vas coughed loudly just as Dr Linlon walked past, saving all three of them from embarrassment At least she was good for something. Reubenish pressed his face into his hands, letting out an annoyed groan that Vas obviously delighted in, and lellenna whispered "thats the noise you make for him, isnt it?" God save him. He looked over to Ouen, and his heart shattered into a million pieces. Ouen was talking to Emersaughyer with a huge grin and a blush on his face. That little (emphasis on little) peice of dog shit. Emersaughyer was glancing over at Reubenish with this smug smirk on his face as Ouen practically fell off a cliff and into emersaughyers arms. Vas coughed beside him. "Did someone's crush not fit into the plot?" She laughs, and lellenna Snickers then adds yet another inappropriate comment,"Not gonna kneel for you now." Reubenish wanted to shrivel into a ball and die. What was he going to do now? All of those tines he thought Ouen was staring back had actually just been him oggling at Emersaughyer. This was torture, this was hell, this was going to be the death if him.</p>
