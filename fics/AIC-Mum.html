I mean to say, what sort of flavour is that?</span></p><p><span>INSPECTOR: It’s the way I like to work.</span></p><p><span>MRS BIRLING: Well, really. But you still haven’t explained why you’re here?</span></p><p><span>BIRLING: It’s probably about Eric’s search history again. [To Eric] Eric, -, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UNDER MY TABLE! AGAIN. </span></p><p><span>INSPECTOR: [Writing in his notebook] I see. [To Mr Birling] Do you recognise this girl?</span></p><p><span>BIRLING: [looking happy] Well yes. We - had a relationship.</span></p><p><span>INSPECTOR: I see.</span></p><p><span>BIRLING: [unimpressed] Well then, if there’s nothing more, you can jolly well leave, or I’ll put my ring doorbell footage of you on my Facebook.</span></p><p><span>ERIC: What about Sn…</span></p><p><span>INSPECTOR: [cutting through massively] [looking at BIRLING]: I’ve called you mum.</span></p><p><span>BIRLING: …</span></p><p><span>INSPECTOR: [looking at ERIC]: I’ve seen your Discord alt accounts.</span></p><p><span>ERIC: …</span></p><p><span>INSPECTOR: [looking at SHEILA]: I know all about your affair.</span></p><p><span>SHEILA: …</span></p><p><span>INSPECTOR: [looking at MRS BIRLING]: Your antics on Facebook have not gone unnoticed.</span></p><p><span>MRS BIRLING: … I don’t see why…</span></p><p><span>BIRLING: [looking slightly shaken]: Now, dear, I will handle this.

They stand in silence, absorbing all that has happened.]</b></p>
