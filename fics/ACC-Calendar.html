        <!-- Day 1-->
        <div id="1">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 1 - Scrooge's undead love</b></h1>
            <p>Marley was dead: to begin with but luckily for Scrooge it didn't last long. </p>
            <p>Seven years after Scrooge lost his only friend, if Marley could be considered as such, he saw his face again in the knocker in his front door and then again merely minutes later in full ghost form. </p>
            <p>"How now! What do you want with me?" Scrooge cried immediately recognising the see-through spirit before him. "Much!" Scrooge shivered as Marley floated towards him - this couldn't be real - his partner was dead he remembered the cheap affair of his funeral and how he was the sole mourner. They conversed for a few minutes more, Scrooge called him "more gravy than grave" due to how delightfully edible he looked in his usual tight waistcoat. Scrooge noticed the chains Marley wore, troubled by them even as he thought of the pleasurable things he could use them for. "You are fettered. Tell me why?" Scrooge trembled, but no longer in fear but anticipation of what the evening might entail. Marley hovered towards him until they were nearly face to face explaining how he forged his own chains but Scrooge was distracted...</p>
            <p>"Have i been a naughty boy, Marley?" He interrupted the ghost's warning and Marley looked in surprise as his old partner pulled him closer by his chains, "Speak comfort to me, Jacob!" "I have none to give." Marley paused and licked his see-through lips, Scrooge bit down on his tongue to contain himself, Marley was so close now, "It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge."  Ebenezer was on his knees before him now "Marley-" he said breathlessly before pulling Marley the rest of the distance to meet his lips. It was as good as he had remembered, seven long years of isolation. Oh, the pain! The agony! But now here he was with Marley his undead partner. Their mouths met over and over, Scrooge moaned erotically as Marley's cold hands pulled his clothes off of him. How he had missed this! How had he lived without him! </p>
            <p>Once their clothes had been shed, Scrooge pulled the spirit on top of him, collapsing into his favourite arm chair (£1.99 off eBay - What a bargain) Marley moaned as he slipped his tongue into Scrooge's mouth and his dick into Scrooge's ass. As Marley fucked him raw, Scrooge felt the joy of Christmas spirit for the first time in seven years.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 2-->
        <div id="2">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 2 - Marley the Whore</b></h1>
            <p>Marley walked into his regular gay bar on Dickens Street; ordered his regular drink, a vodka soda; walked over to his usual booth, where he found a grumpy looking tart he had never seen before; sat down and checked out the guy before him. He was new, Marley knew everyone who came here (he had fucked most of the men (Marley was a whore)) the guy across from him was currently glaring, which was only turning Marley on more. </p>
            <p>"Who are you?" Marley asked the man before him. "My name is Ebenezer Scrooge." "What are you a fucking victorian or some shit?" Marley looked at him again, he did look a bit old (just how he liked them), "My name's Jacob Marley, the local whore." He smirked at Ebenezer, who only glared at him in return, "My partner died. I only came here to get shitfaced for as little money as possible." Oh fuck Marley thought - he was dealing with a widow he had to change tactics.</p>
            <p>Marley slid his leg against Scrooges under the table, licking his lips as he did so, trying to gage his reaction. Scrooge frowned yet didn't pull his leg away, in-fact he pushed it closer towards Marley - that horny old bastard Marley thought. "I'm going to the bathroom-" Marley glanced at Scrooge as he stood up hoping he would get the hint, before walking away without looking back. </p>
            <p>The door banged shut behind Marley and before he could even turn around it was opening again, he was grabbed and pinned to a wall in the nearest bathroom stall by a flustered looking Scrooge. "You're going to owe me a drink after this." Scrooge growled, "I don't do things for free."</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 3-->
        <div id="3">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 3</b></h1>
            <p>Not been added yet.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 4-->
        <div id="4">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 4 - I'm not straight, I mean gay.</b></h1>
            <p>Scrooge sat in the darkness, as he liked it. Darkness was cheap and he was the biggest cheapskate on the planet, he ate gruel to save money and he lived with his business partner because it meant more business profits, definitely not because he was in love with him. Scrooge couldn't be gay, of course he wasn't, he had a fiancée long ago and now he didn't love anyone but Marley money. Scrooge shifted in his chair (£1.99 off eBay) his thoughts made him uncomfortable, but secrets were spilled and everything became more believable after midnight. Scrooge needed to clear his head, it was Christmas Eve - his most hated holiday - and now he was having a sexuality crisis, he couldn't cope with sleeping in the same bed as his 'business' partner tonight.</p>
            <p>Closing the door behind him, Scrooge walked out onto the freezing street, his shoes clicked on the pavement as the beggars lining the street shifted uncomfortably away from him. Scrooge didn't feel powerful or rich only miserable and gay, in his mind he was as bad as his clerk or the pathetic peasants who went about with a Merry Christmas on their lips. Christmas his ass, "Bah" he said aloud startling the family sleeping in the alley beside him, "Humbug." Humbug to Christmas and homosexuality and wanting to sleep with his partner. Scrooge was done.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 5-->
        <div id="5">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 5 - Just two bros... No homo...</b></h1>
            <p>Dick had always been rather attached to Scrooge since they began working as apprentices for Fezziwig. Their relationship could be described as brother-like, they were as close as two young men could be under the reign of the late Queen Victoria without being accused of queerness.  </p>
            <p>It was the end of Fezziwig's annual Christmas ball and the two boys were left to their beds beneath a counter in the back of the shop, both of them were excited and content with their lives. Dick watched Ebenezer intently, idolising his every movement as they joked merrily with each other about the evening's events and their future lives. "Do you think you will ever marry, Dick?" Dick blushed lightly, taken aback by the question, "I would like to but i doubt I will ever find a woman." This was partially true, Dick did want to get married only the problem was less 'not finding a woman' and more the growing realisation that he might not be as interested in women as he originally thought. "Well there's always men, my friend." Ebenezer joked, pausing at Dick's lightly concerned face. "You look like you've seen a ghost." This was quite ironic coming from Scrooge. "I was only joking. Unless you are..." Scrooge couldn't bring himself to say 'gay' the word was to filled with hope and fear, he wished deeply that Dick was gay, they could perhaps fall in love and remain together for the rest of their lives. No. He had to stop, it was just another fantasy. Dick finally laughed, "No of course I'm not a homosexual, can you imagine. Lol." (Like a lying liar Dick had just lied.) Scrooge felt his heart crush inside his chest, "oh." He replied sadly.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 6-->
        <div id="6">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 6 - You're my boss... But maybe...</b></h1>
            <p>Scrooge admired his joyful boss Fezziwig,  some could argue that he admired him slightly more than platonically (they would be correct). </p>
            <p>It was Fezziwig's annual Christmas party, Scrooge, Dick and the Fezziwigs' other guests were busy dancing filled with Christmas spirit, cheer and all that other cringy shit. Laughing merrily as Mr and Mrs Fezziwig danced together. As the clock struck the eleventh hour the guests began to leave until only Fezziwig, his family and the apprentices were left. Dick quickly returned to his and Scrooge's room and Fezziwig's wife and daughters began to walk home laughing happily in the snow. "Yo Ho, Ebenezer!" Fezziwig called out to him. He smiled lightly feeling the butterflies fluttering in his stomach - he knew he shouldn't have eaten those caterpillars. "Fezziwig?" He began cautiously, "Yes my boy?" The two of them were close now, Ebenezer took a deep breath, "I love you." </p>
            <p>Fezziwig blinked, "I deeply care for you yet I cannot feel for you in that same way." He saw the disappointment etched onto Scrooge's face. "I am sorry my boy but I have a wife, besides you deserve someone younger and better than an old man like me." Scrooge sighed and swore to himself that from this day forward he would no longer have a single scrap of enjoyment at Christmas (this was a major overreaction but Ebenezer was just like that).</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 7-->
        <div id="7">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 7 - If only there was more time</b></h1>
            <p>Scrooge had left Fezziwig's employment to start his own company with his newfound business partner Marley. He did rather miss working with Fezziwig and his fellow apprentice Dick, yet his heart had been seized by the promise of money. </p>
            <p>It was an evening in early December, Marley had already left the counting house to retire to their shared apartment, when Scrooge received a letter. He opened it lazily expecting it to be another complaint from a customer him and Marley had robbed of the poor sods money. It was not. Instead it was a letter that took him quite by surprise, his old fellow apprentice Dick had died that very morning of tuberculosis. Scrooge sat in complete shock, questioning his entire life. How had the one person he had loved died so soon, he felt hollow inside, how he wished now he had confessed his true feelings. Now it could never be done.</p>
            <p>Scrooge didn't return home that night.</p>
            <p>Or the next night.</p>
            <p>Or the next.</p>
            <p>By the third night Marley began to worry, Scrooge had disappeared without trace a few nights before. There business looked like it could go under if he did not return soon.</p>
            <p>Scrooge was not in fact missing, he was in a nearby cemetery attending Dick's funeral. He was one of the sole mourners as Fezziwig could not make it. As the service ended, Scrooge was left alone sitting beside his grave. How he regretted his decisions, if only he had told the truth Dick may still be alive, it could be he who worked alongside him at the counting house but Scrooge had failed. He was a coward and he knew it.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 8-->
        <div id="8">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 8 - Naughty Clerk</b></h1>
            <p>Beneath Ebenezer's cold demeanour was an incredibly horny homosexual man. And beneath Bob's energetic and joyful front was a masochist who just wanted to be spanked. </p>
            <p>The ruler (spanking-stick) stood in the corner of the clerk's office, a looming shadow of what went on behind closed doors in that dank little counting-house. </p>
            <p>It was Christmas Eve, Bob was about to leave to go home when Scrooge called him back into his office, as Bob walked back he saw Scrooge sat upon his desk ruler in hand, "Seen as though you will not be working tomorrow, you owe me half-a-crown... I can think of way for you to repay me my lost profits." "Yes sir, of course sir. Just... make sure the wife never finds out." Bob nearly tripped over getting towards him and Scrooge smirked already unbuttoning his shirt. </p>
            <p>Mere seconds later, Bob was bent naked over Scrooge's desk moaning every time Scrooge brought the ruler down harshly on his bare ass. What an incredible Christmas present this is, he thought weakly to himself. </p>
            <p>When they were finished Scrooge slipped back into his threatening and cold manner, "Get out of here, I don't want to see you until the day after tomorrow!" Bob scurried away as Scrooge sighed, why did he treat his first lover since Marley with such hatred? He had no answer for himself only that he was embarrassed to feel such emotions for a lowly working class peasant. He closed up the counting house alone and walked home regretting his actions towards the man whim he loved.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 9-->
        <div id="9">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 9 - Employee to fuck buddy</b></h1>
            <p>Bob Cratchit hated his employer, he hated him with a burning passion with every ounce of his being - unfortunately Bob also found him incredibly attractive, which was unhelpful. Scrooge had no respect for how Bob worked his arse off day in day out to provide for his family, yet all the hard earned money Bob made was put straight (or rather gay) into Scrooge's pocket as poor old Bob Cratchit sat around a pitiful fire containing only one measly lump of coal freezing his non-existent tits off. </p>
            <p>The day after Christmas, the one day in the whole year Bob had off, he arrived into the office late practically sprinting to his stool - desperately hoping Scrooge did not realise his lateness. "Hallo!" Scrooge growled, how that voice turned Bob on even in the face of such terror, "What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?" "I am very sorry, sir, I am behind my time." Bob began hurriedly. "You are?" Said Scrooge, "Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir, if you please." Bob was blabbering pleas now until Scrooge announced he was raising his salary.</p>
            <p>Bob stood slack jawed before his employer, who in a sudden change of events had become generous. He looked up into Scrooge's usually cold eyes and saw a hint of warmth in them, that was reflected in the genuine smile he wore on his lips. Bob's eyes flicked again to Ebenezer's lips, unfortunately this didn't go unnoticed, fortunately Scrooge liked the attention as he closed the gap between them. </p>
            <p>Bob gasped as their lips met, Scrooge pulled him into the nearby cupboard, still kissing him ferociously. Bob pulled his clothes off yet couldn't feel the cold, his Christmas wish had cum come true.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 10-->
        <div id="10">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 10 - A ghost of gay bars yet to come</b></h1>
            <p>"Oh spirt, pray tell me where we are now." Scrooge shivered, "I beg you do not show of anymore suffering I will cause." The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come remained silent only lifting a single finger to point towards a sign at the end of the street. Scrooge moaned lightly, "Oh good spirit, where have you brought me?" His hands shook as he brushed snow off the sign, "Discreet Gentleman's Club?" He read aloud, "Homosexuals only?" The spirt nodded its hooded head slowly. "Spirt there must be some mix up, I am not queer." If the ghost had had visible facial expressions it would have looked largely sceptical, instead it only tilted its head as if to say 'Really faguette? You think you are heterosexual?' Scrooge grumbled yet nonetheless slipped inside, this was not just his redemption, it was also his awakening.</p>
            <p>A few hours later, Scrooge reemerged onto the street grinning lightly, he must've had a good fuck, "Thank you kind spirit for all you have done, I understand now and have learnt my lesson, I only hope I can do enough to save Tiny Tim." And with that The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come whisked him back to his present.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 11-->
        <div id="11">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 11 - You're a frog. But that doesn't matter, right?</b></h1>
            <p>After the Christmas of Scrooge's redemption, the working relationship between Ebenezer and Bob had changed drastically. Of course their relationship was purely platonic (Bob had a wife and was a frog) yet they spent more and more time together, Bob even began staying late in the office gossiping - or Scrooge's equivalent at least - until the late hours of the night. His wife had brought up the matter after several occasions of Bob returning home to cold dinners and sleeping children, she had called his behaviour 'suspicious' and a fracture had grown between them. </p>
            <p>On one such evening the two of them sat upon Scrooge's desk chatting, "How's your wife Bob?" Ebenezer asked bitterly. "She is suspicious of our relationship. She thinks I'm having an affair." "With me? But that's illegal. Wait, we aren't having an affair... are we." Scrooge was slightly concerned now. "Ebenezer, I think you would know if we were having an affair, besides I'm a frog and you aren't gay." Bob said with a slight air of depression, "Unless you are gay..." The hope had returned to his voice. "I mean... I wouldn't say I'm exactly straight. And well... the frog part... I wouldn't object to it, I mean your wife manages and she's a pig (no offence to her). So if you're gay I'm down." Bob stared at him, what the frickity frackity fuckity fuck was happening. "Yeah..." was all he managed to say. His wife was gonna be pissed.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 12-->
        <div id="12">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 12 -  The domestic life of the spirits.</b></h1>
            <p>The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future sat around a large fireplace, they had returned to their home from the world of humans and evil capitalism. The giant known as the Ghost of Christmas Present laughed merrily with the Ghost of Christmas Past, reminiscing about their lives. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come remained silently in the corner, it lacked the same jolliness as its other partners, seeing the future was seeing too much. </p>
            <p>"Come in and know me better!" The Ghost of Christmas Present called out to it and the Ghost of Christmas Past beckoned it too. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come drifted ominously - its signature style - towards its two 'roommates'. The Ghost of Christmas Present leaned back to press a kiss on its hooded head, until he realised how unresponsive the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was, "You could at least seem happy to be with us." They sighed disappointedly as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come only nodded silently. They sighed again causing himself to laugh joyfully, "It's Christmas cheer up, you're nearly as bad as the guys we have to fix." At this the Ghost of Christmas Past giggled like child, its form was incomprehensible, adult, child, male, female were not things that existed separately in this particular spirit. </p>
            <p>As the clock on the mantle piece ticked closer to midnight on Christmas Day the ghosts prepared themselves to drift on in the world, gone forever until the next year.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 13-->
        <div id="13">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 13 - WTF I'm dead?</b></h1>
            <p>Marley had just died. In his first few moments as a ghost he became aware of two things, a chain wrapped around him and a second spirit floating beside him. "Whaghht?" He croaked, "Who the fuck are you?" The ghost came into full view now, "In life my name was Dick Wilkins, I was your old partner's ex lover." Marley blinked slowly at him, his brain was fuzzy and being dead didn't seem to suit him much, "Scrooge never mentioned you." Dick nodded sadly, "After my death at a young age I watched him carefully, I believe that in the end he forgot me." "Damn that sucks." Was the only thing Marley could think to say.</p>
            <p>They sat in silence for a while, until Marley asked, "Why am I in chains?" "Your miserly and misanthropic ways in life have lead you to this point." Dick replied. "And will the same fate become of dear old Ebenezer?" "Yep." Marley stared at Dick, "We must warn him!" "No." "Why the fuck not." Dick shrugged, "Wait another 7 years, THEN you can tell him." "Why do I have to wait so long?" Marley asked frustratedly. "To enhance the plot." Dick said.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 14-->
        <div id="14">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 14 - The Ghost of Christmas yet to Come</b></h1>
            <p>Scrooge found himself face-to-face with the third of the apparitions that he was to see.</p>
            <p><b>“Scrooge. I am the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come”.</b></p>
            <p>“Well, yeah. That’s kind of cool” said Scrooge. “Look, I’ve already seen someone’s jaw drop off, been shown traumatic childhood memories and overall blackmailed into being good. I’ve learnt my blinking lesson, and I want to go home”. Scrooge huffed and sat down heavily on a nearby bench, which he fazed through, and landed on his bottom on the ground. (He was very embarassed)</p>
            <p><b>“You have learnt your lesson, then?”</b> said the ghost. “Oh for goodness sakes, yes”, said Scrooge, getting up and attempting to wipe the mud off his favourite dressing gown.</p>
            <p><b>“Well. I have only 1 hour to live, Scrooge.</b> (The ghosts were created against their will) <b>[Sadder now]</b> <i>Can we do something together before that scumbag Charles Dickens brings me back?”</i>. Scrooge was rather taken aback by this - if he hadn’t been convinced to be kind before, he was now. “Umm… Sure? Tell me a bit about yourself.” he said.</p>
            <p><i>“Oh. I don’t really know. Haven’t had a chance to figure it out, really”.</i> “We could start with your gender?”, asked Scrooge.</p>
            <p>The ghost of Christmas Past, or “Dave”, as we shall now call it, was dressed in a thick black sheet that enveloped the entirety of his body. His head was cast in shadow so that no one would ever see it (if it even existed). It was going to be tricky to figure this out. <i>“Gender? What’s a gender?”</i>, the ghost inquired.</p>
            <p>Scrooge sighed. Although, he pondered, it didn’t really matter very much to him, or the ghost. “Well, umm, <b>[Scrooge thinks]</b>, Dave. Basically, humans need to reproduce, right?”</p>
            <p>And so went a long and hard conversation, in which Dave endeavored to learn all about the world, and Scrooge tried to teach him enough about the world so that he would be able to be gay, and therefore acceptable by Scrooge’s standards. Homosexuality was illegal in the Industrial Revolution, so Scrooge wanted to make use of it while no-one was watching.</p>

            <p>Bob had a secret he could never tell anyone, not his wife, not his kids and certainly not his employer. He was gay. And he was in love with Scrooge's nephew.</p>
            <p>Inside the cold and draughty counting house, Bob shivered in his little cell with one sad coal on the fire. The door suddenly burst open revealing Fred, he beamed at Bob, who blushed immediately like the little romantic he was, "Merry Christmas, Uncle!" Cried Fred cheerfully. Bob looked wistfully at him as Fred continued debating Christmas with the heartless Scrooge. Bob watched Fred intently, committing his ruddy, handsome face and sparkling eyes to memory - he would imagine those features later that night before his wife came to bed. </p>
            <p>Bob locked back into the conversation to hear Fred's beautiful speech. "There are many things from which I have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say. Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come around as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of in the long calendar of the year, where men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys." Bob stared at him slack-jawed, it was the most glorious thing he had ever seen or heard. "And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!" Bob immediately burst into applause, he had never been as in love as he was now. Scrooge scolded him for being out of line and he hurried over to the fire extinguishing the final flame. </p>
            <p>As Fred left, he bestowed a "Merry Christmas!" upon Bob who returned it with as much love and affection as possible while Scrooge grumbled in his office. It had been the best day of his life - a 'Merry Christmas' wished upon him from the man he loved so very dearly. At that moment he thought nothing could bring him down, until he noticed Scrooge behind him.</p>

        <div id="17">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 17 - Scrooge's confession</b></h1>
            <p>Scrooge had to tell someone about his newfound revelation, but it was the 19th century, and most people were raging homophobes. Belle—his sweetheart, his fiancée—would be nice about him being gay, right? She definitely wouldn’t send him to an insane asylum... right?</p>
            <p>As he walked to her house, he started to doubt. What if Belle wouldn’t accept him? What if this was the end of everything? So absorbed in the possibility of rejection, he walked straight into Belle’s front door.</p>
            <p>"Ebenezer?" Belle’s voice called out, muffled by the door. "How unexpected of you, coming to my house," she added with a smile—until she noticed the anxiety on his face. The smile faltered.</p>
            <p>"What's wrong, Scrooge?"</p>
            <p>"I think... I think I may be gay, Belle." He sighed. "For Marley. He's very hot."</p>
            <p>Belle stood there, speechless. It was surprising, yes—considering they were engaged and had been in love—but still... "Wow," she managed, blinking a few times.</p>
            <p>Scrooge shifted uncomfortably, then blurted, "We can still get married, Belle. I think that would work."</p>
            <p>Belle frowned, her brow furrowing with confusion. "Scrooge, you don't want to be my husband do you?"</p>
            <p>He shook his head, sheepishly. "No."</p>
            <p>"Then we can just be friends, okay?" Belle offered with a quiet sigh.</p>
            <p>Scrooge exhaled in relief, grateful that Belle wasn’t as homophobic as the rest of Victorian society. "Thanks, Belle," he said, "Now I’m going to go and kiss Marley." With that, he skipped off into the sunset—gaily and gayly—before tripping over a pothole and stumbling into the street.</p>
            <p>Belle groaned, half laughing. She was mildly scared that Scrooge would become even more of a social outcast now that he realized he was gay, but at least he was happy. Maybe this was just what Belle needed to explore life properly. Maybe she should try polyamory after all... There was that hot girl that worked in the bakery down the street and that butcher boy down the road with the nice ass. Belle had options...</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 18 - "Business" partners</b></h1>
            <p>It was Christmas morning, an ordinary work day for Scrooge and Marley the infamous business partners. Most days they both awoke at 5am like clockwork climbing out of their shared bed (sharing was to save money of course), dressing quickly and eating their cheap gruel but today was different. </p>
            <p>The first thing quite out of the ordinary that Christmas morning was that Scrooge awoke to Marley's arms wrapped around him, usually they both remained firmly on their sides of the bed, secondly Scrooge did not attempt to remove his arms or move at all - he tried not to overthink the touch-starved implications of his enjoyment of being held or what it could mean for their relationship. Thirdly when 5am arose and they detangled their limbs without a word, Marley suggested a preposterous idea. "Scrooge, as it is Christmas Day and we will likely have no customers, perhaps it is wise to give ourselves the day off?" Scrooge stare slack-jawed at Marley as though his proposal was the strangest thing to happen that day.</p>
            <p>Eventually, Scrooge grudgingly agreed for the both of them to remain at home. They sat together in their living room silently, with an absolute maximum of 2 coals on the fire. Scrooge debated internally whether to bring up the events of the night before, he decided against it until Marley cleared his throat, "Ebenezer, about last night..." Scrooge nearly chocked on air (he was well elegant like that), "What do you mean?" "Well," said Marley, "When I awoke this morning you were already awake and I was hugging you." Scrooge blushed like a lovesick teenage girl, "And...? I wasn't aware I was being judged." Marley grinned, "Well I was wondering if you wanted another cuddle." </p>
            <p>A hours later, the two of them were back in their double bed. Scrooge was snuggled into Marley's chest like a new born baby doing skin-to-skin contact (unfortunately for the both of them clothes were in the way). As Scrooge drifted into sleep Marley kissed his forehead, "I love you Ebenezer, you cold hearted bitch - affectionate."</p>

        <div id="19">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 19 - Merry Miserley Chirstmas</b></h1>
            <p>It was the 25th of December 1835, Marley's last Christmas. It was unknown to both Marley and Scrooge that the next year would be spent in solitude, either 6ft under or mourning alone and eating gruel. </p>
            <p>It was mid afternoon and they both were considerably angry, how dare the peasants outside sound happy, when their grumpiness was interrupted by a sharp knock on the door. Scrooge rose from his chair, £1.99 off eBay, mumbling about 'another bloody caroller'. Marley followed him down the wide staircase, curious to see how his partner would banish this one. Unfortunately, it was Scrooge's insistent nephew. "Uncles!" He cried merrily, "A Merry Christmas to you both my dear family!"</p>
            <p>Scrooge attempted to shut the door in Fred's face but he had already marched inside, "The two of you really ought to spruce up the place a little, it's awfully dreary." "Yes, thank you nephew, please leave." "But what should I do without my favourite uncle and his husband on Christmas Day." Scrooge sighed, "Marley is not my husband" (this was a lie) "and I am your only uncle so I must be your favourite." Fred rolled his eyes, yet even that was all in good spirt, how the idiot man could do it Scrooge would never know, jolliness was not a concept Ebenezer nor Jacob stumbled across often. "Good Afternoon." Scrooge repeated several times interrupting Fred, who simply replied, "Very well Uncles have it your way, A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!" Fred turned and left without another word as Scrooge and Marley retreated back upstairs.</p>

        <div id="20">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 20 - A very Merry Pride</b></h1>
            <p>Fred walked gaily along the street to his usual gay bar whistling merrily. As he entered he was greeted by his usual fuck drinking buddies yet he also spotted something or rather someone else. He grinned, he would recognise that surly figure anywhere, and strode over to him, "A Very Merry Pride, Uncle Scrooge." Fred's friends crowded around the two of them shocked at how two very different people could possibly be related. "Bah." Was Scrooges reply, "Nonsense. There is no 'merry' anything, nephew." "But uncle why are you here, are you... gay?" Scrooge coughed and stood up slowly, "Good afternoon." As he turned to leave Fred pulled him back, "Uncle Scrooge, please do stay, I never meant to offend you I was only questioning your purpose here." He paused, inviting Scrooge to tell him his purpose, Scrooge just glared at him, "Fine uncle don't explain to the people who could help you, anyway how about you come to my house tomorrow, my wife and I are having a party." Scrooge merely said "Good afternoon." Fred tried to object, "Uncle-" "Good Afternoon." </p>
            <p>A day later, Scrooge stood before his nephew's house seriously regretting his life, his old partner - Marley - had warned him once before of the dangers of the chains forged in life; maybe now was the time to break free.</p>
            <p>Fred jumped with glee when he saw his uncle enter his home, "UNCLE!" He yelled, runing over and throwing his arms around Scrooge. Scrooge was as responsive to the hug as a dead fish going through rigor morits. Fred's wife joined them, "Ebenezer, I'm surprised you came?" She said glancing suspiciously at Scrooge who cleared his throat, "I have something to confess dearest nephew." Scrooge paused for dramatic effect like the extra little shit he was, "I'm bisexual."  </p>
            <p>"Same. But no shit Sherlock." Said Fred, "My gaydar isn't that bad." "Well now you know." Scrooge said simply and left leaving an astonished Fred and his wife behind him. "Well I never would have suspected that." Fred's wife muttered. "He reminds me of myself when I used to be a girl." Fred said smiling as he saw Scrooge's shadow disappear into the distance.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 21 - You're me and I'm you but you're a frog</b></h1>
            <p>One early Sunday morning after the Christmas of Scrooge's redemption Bob Cratchit received a knock on his door that would change his life (for the worse). Mrs Cratchit was making breakfast for their six children when Bob opened the door to find a fucking frog on his door step. "Who are you?" He asked warily. "My name is Bob Cratchit, although sometimes people call me Kermit the Frog." The frog on his doorstep replied calmly. "Please tell me I'm hallucinating or that this is a dream," the human Bob pinched himself confirming that he had in fact gone mad. "I think we ought to go on a walk," frog Bob suggested.</p>
            <p>"So let me get this peculiar matter straight, You're me and I'm you but for some strange and quite frankly unapparent reason you are also a frog." The two Bobs were now sat together on a bench while the human Bob had a rather valid crash out. "Yep, basically I'm you but from another version of Charles Dickens's work." Said frog Bob, unfortunately this did not ease the mind of human Bob as he hadn't quite got the gist of not being real, "What- what do you mean? I-We're what?" Frog Bob nodded sympathetically, "I understand, it's hard to wrap your head around being a story and not a functioning person." Bob gaped at him, "On the upside you are one of the main characters so you're practically immortal." Unfortunately this statement was shrouded in irony as as frog Bob Cratchit uttered these words the human version of him fainted dead away, unable to grasp anymore of this newfound version of so called life. "Oops." Frog Bob said.</p>

            <p>Scrooge, Marley, Cratchit, Fezziwig and Wilkins had been best friends and partners in a joint business for a long time. The 5 of them were the oddest group of people you could find at a gay bar, Scrooge and Marley exhibited a cold demeanour at great contrast to Fezziwig and Wilkins who both had off the scale aura and rizz. Bob was just there for the gay sex and vibes.</p>
            <p>Scrooge had bought the final round of the day - he had tried to get away with spending no money like the last 4 times they had gone out together yet unfortunately had failed - he carried the drinks back to the table and his tipsy 'friends'. The last time the five of them had been out they had gotten rather too drunk and ended up having a gang bang, they had not spoken of the event since; all of them secretly wished they had been more sober to savour the moment. </p>
            <p>As they finished their final round of drinks, Dick Wilkins suggested they all go back to his flat as it was 'nearby'. They stumbled out of the bar talking and laughing loudly as Dick lead the way back home. Once the door had been shut behind a drunken Jacob Marley they were confronted with a slight problem in the tiny apartment, there was only one bed... so of course the logical option was to sleep together and have sex again...</p>
