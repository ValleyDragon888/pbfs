            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 1 - Scrooge's undead love</b></h1>
            <p>Marley was dead: to begin with but luckily for Scrooge it didn't last long. </p>
            <p>Seven years after Scrooge lost his only friend, if Marley could be considered as such, he saw his face again in the knocker in his front door and then again merely minutes later in full ghost form. </p>
            <p>"How now! What do you want with me?" Scrooge cried immediately recognising the see-through spirit before him. "Much!" Scrooge shivered as Marley floated towards him - this couldn't be real - his partner was dead he remembered the cheap affair of his funeral and how he was the sole mourner. They conversed for a few minutes more, Scrooge called him "more gravy than grave" due to how delightfully edible he looked in his usual tight waistcoat. Scrooge noticed the chains Marley wore, troubled by them even as he thought of the pleasurable things he could use them for. "You are fettered. Tell me why?" Scrooge trembled, but no longer in fear but anticipation of what the evening might entail. Marley hovered towards him until they were nearly face to face explaining how he forged his own chains but Scrooge was distracted...</p>
            <p>"Have i been a naughty boy, Marley?" He interrupted the ghost's warning and Marley looked in surprise as his old partner pulled him closer by his chains, "Speak comfort to me, Jacob!" "I have none to give." Marley paused and licked his see-through lips, Scrooge bit down on his tongue to contain himself, Marley was so close now, "It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge."  Ebenezer was on his knees before him now "Marley-" he said breathlessly before pulling Marley the rest of the distance to meet his lips. It was as good as he had remembered, seven long years of isolation. Oh, the pain! The agony! But now here he was with Marley his undead partner. Their mouths met over and over, Scrooge moaned erotically as Marley's cold hands pulled his clothes off of him. How he had missed this! How had he lived without him! </p>
            <p>Once their clothes had been shed, Scrooge pulled the spirit on top of him, collapsing into his favourite arm chair (£1.99 off eBay - What a bargain) Marley moaned as he slipped his tongue into Scrooge's mouth and his dick into Scrooge's ass. As Marley fucked him raw, Scrooge felt the joy of Christmas spirit for the first time in seven years.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Day 2-->
        <div id="2">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 2 - Marley the Whore</b></h1>
            <p>Marley walked into his regular gay bar on Dickens Street; ordered his regular drink, a vodka soda; walked over to his usual booth, where he found a grumpy looking tart he had never seen before; sat down and checked out the guy before him. He was new, Marley knew everyone who came here (he had fucked most of the men (Marley was a whore)) the guy across from him was currently glaring, which was only turning Marley on more. </p>
            <p>"Who are you?" Marley asked the man before him. "My name is Ebenezer Scrooge." "What are you a fucking victorian or some shit?" Marley looked at him again, he did look a bit old (just how he liked them), "My name's Jacob Marley, the local whore." He smirked at Ebenezer, who only glared at him in return, "My partner died. I only came here to get shitfaced for as little money as possible." Oh fuck Marley thought - he was dealing with a widow he had to change tactics.</p>
            <p>Marley slid his leg against Scrooges under the table, licking his lips as he did so, trying to gage his reaction. Scrooge frowned yet didn't pull his leg away, in-fact he pushed it closer towards Marley - that horny old bastard Marley thought. "I'm going to the bathroom-" Marley glanced at Scrooge as he stood up hoping he would get the hint, before walking away without looking back. </p>
            <p>The door banged shut behind Marley and before he could even turn around it was opening again, he was grabbed and pinned to a wall in the nearest bathroom stall by a flustered looking Scrooge. "You're going to owe me a drink after this." Scrooge growled, "I don't do things for free."</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 4 - I'm not straight, I mean gay.</b></h1>
            <p>Scrooge sat in the darkness, as he liked it. Darkness was cheap and he was the biggest cheapskate on the planet, he ate gruel to save money and he lived with his business partner because it meant more business profits, definitely not because he was in love with him. Scrooge couldn't be gay, of course he wasn't, he had a fiancée long ago and now he didn't love anyone but Marley money. Scrooge shifted in his chair (£1.99 off eBay) his thoughts made him uncomfortable, but secrets were spilled and everything became more believable after midnight. Scrooge needed to clear his head, it was Christmas Eve - his most hated holiday - and now he was having a sexuality crisis, he couldn't cope with sleeping in the same bed as his 'business' partner tonight.</p>
            <p>Closing the door behind him, Scrooge walked out onto the freezing street, his shoes clicked on the pavement as the beggars lining the street shifted uncomfortably away from him. Scrooge didn't feel powerful or rich only miserable and gay, in his mind he was as bad as his clerk or the pathetic peasants who went about with a Merry Christmas on their lips. Christmas his ass, "Bah" he said aloud startling the family sleeping in the alley beside him, "Humbug." Humbug to Christmas and homosexuality and wanting to sleep with his partner. Scrooge was done.</p>

            <p>Bob Cratchit hated his employer, he hated him with a burning passion with every ounce of his being - unfortunately Bob also found him incredibly attractive, which was unhelpful. Scrooge had no respect for how Bob worked his arse off day in day out to provide for his family, yet all the hard earned money Bob made was put straight (or rather gay) into Scrooge's pocket as poor old Bob Cratchit sat around a pitiful fire containing only one measly lump of coal freezing his non-existent tits off. </p>
            <p>The day after Christmas, the one day in the whole year Bob had off, he arrived into the office late practically sprinting to his stool - desperately hoping Scrooge did not realise his lateness. "Hallo!" Scrooge growled, how that voice turned Bob on even in the face of such terror, "What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?" "I am very sorry, sir, I am behind my time." Bob began hurriedly. "You are?" Said Scrooge, "Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir, if you please." Bob was blabbering pleas now until Scrooge announced he was raising his salary.</p>
            <p>Bob stood slack jawed before his employer, who in a sudden change of events had become generous. He looked up into Scrooge's usually cold eyes and saw a hint of warmth in them, that was reflected in the genuine smile he wore on his lips. Bob's eyes flicked again to Ebenezer's lips, unfortunately this didn't go unnoticed, fortunately Scrooge liked the attention as he closed the gap between them. </p>
            <p>Bob gasped as their lips met, Scrooge pulled him into the nearby cupboard, still kissing him ferociously. Bob pulled his clothes off yet couldn't feel the cold, his Christmas wish had cum come true.</p>

        <div id="10">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 10 - A ghost of gay bars yet to come</b></h1>
            <p>"Oh spirt, pray tell me where we are now." Scrooge shivered, "I beg you do not show of anymore suffering I will cause." The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come remained silent only lifting a single finger to point towards a sign at the end of the street. Scrooge moaned lightly, "Oh good spirit, where have you brought me?" His hands shook as he brushed snow off the sign, "Discreet Gentleman's Club?" He read aloud, "Homosexuals only?" The spirt nodded its hooded head slowly. "Spirt there must be some mix up, I am not queer." If the ghost had had visible facial expressions it would have looked largely sceptical, instead it only tilted its head as if to say 'Really faguette? You think you are heterosexual?' Scrooge grumbled yet nonetheless slipped inside, this was not just his redemption, it was also his awakening.</p>
            <p>A few hours later, Scrooge reemerged onto the street grinning lightly, he must've had a good fuck, "Thank you kind spirit for all you have done, I understand now and have learnt my lesson, I only hope I can do enough to save Tiny Tim." And with that The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come whisked him back to his present.</p>

            <p>Scrooge had to tell someone about his newfound revelation, but it was the 19th century, and most people were raging homophobes. Belle—his sweetheart, his fiancée—would be nice about him being gay, right? She definitely wouldn’t send him to an insane asylum... right?</p>
            <p>As he walked to her house, he started to doubt. What if Belle wouldn’t accept him? What if this was the end of everything? So absorbed in the possibility of rejection, he walked straight into Belle’s front door.</p>
            <p>"Ebenezer?" Belle’s voice called out, muffled by the door. "How unexpected of you, coming to my house," she added with a smile—until she noticed the anxiety on his face. The smile faltered.</p>
            <p>"What's wrong, Scrooge?"</p>
            <p>"I think... I think I may be gay, Belle." He sighed. "For Marley. He's very hot."</p>
            <p>Belle stood there, speechless. It was surprising, yes—considering they were engaged and had been in love—but still... "Wow," she managed, blinking a few times.</p>
            <p>Scrooge shifted uncomfortably, then blurted, "We can still get married, Belle. I think that would work."</p>
            <p>Belle frowned, her brow furrowing with confusion. "Scrooge, you don't want to be my husband do you?"</p>
            <p>He shook his head, sheepishly. "No."</p>
            <p>"Then we can just be friends, okay?" Belle offered with a quiet sigh.</p>
            <p>Scrooge exhaled in relief, grateful that Belle wasn’t as homophobic as the rest of Victorian society. "Thanks, Belle," he said, "Now I’m going to go and kiss Marley." With that, he skipped off into the sunset—gaily and gayly—before tripping over a pothole and stumbling into the street.</p>
            <p>Belle groaned, half laughing. She was mildly scared that Scrooge would become even more of a social outcast now that he realized he was gay, but at least he was happy. Maybe this was just what Belle needed to explore life properly. Maybe she should try polyamory after all... There was that hot girl that worked in the bakery down the street and that butcher boy down the road with the nice ass. Belle had options...</p>

            <p>Fred walked gaily along the street to his usual gay bar whistling merrily. As he entered he was greeted by his usual fuck drinking buddies yet he also spotted something or rather someone else. He grinned, he would recognise that surly figure anywhere, and strode over to him, "A Very Merry Pride, Uncle Scrooge." Fred's friends crowded around the two of them shocked at how two very different people could possibly be related. "Bah." Was Scrooges reply, "Nonsense. There is no 'merry' anything, nephew." "But uncle why are you here, are you... gay?" Scrooge coughed and stood up slowly, "Good afternoon." As he turned to leave Fred pulled him back, "Uncle Scrooge, please do stay, I never meant to offend you I was only questioning your purpose here." He paused, inviting Scrooge to tell him his purpose, Scrooge just glared at him, "Fine uncle don't explain to the people who could help you, anyway how about you come to my house tomorrow, my wife and I are having a party." Scrooge merely said "Good afternoon." Fred tried to object, "Uncle-" "Good Afternoon." </p>
            <p>A day later, Scrooge stood before his nephew's house seriously regretting his life, his old partner - Marley - had warned him once before of the dangers of the chains forged in life; maybe now was the time to break free.</p>
            <p>Fred jumped with glee when he saw his uncle enter his home, "UNCLE!" He yelled, runing over and throwing his arms around Scrooge. Scrooge was as responsive to the hug as a dead fish going through rigor morits. Fred's wife joined them, "Ebenezer, I'm surprised you came?" She said glancing suspiciously at Scrooge who cleared his throat, "I have something to confess dearest nephew." Scrooge paused for dramatic effect like the extra little shit he was, "I'm bisexual."  </p>
            <p>"Same. But no shit Sherlock." Said Fred, "My gaydar isn't that bad." "Well now you know." Scrooge said simply and left leaving an astonished Fred and his wife behind him. "Well I never would have suspected that." Fred's wife muttered. "He reminds me of myself when I used to be a girl." Fred said smiling as he saw Scrooge's shadow disappear into the distance.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 21 - You're me and I'm you but you're a frog</b></h1>
            <p>One early Sunday morning after the Christmas of Scrooge's redemption Bob Cratchit received a knock on his door that would change his life (for the worse). Mrs Cratchit was making breakfast for their six children when Bob opened the door to find a fucking frog on his door step. "Who are you?" He asked warily. "My name is Bob Cratchit, although sometimes people call me Kermit the Frog." The frog on his doorstep replied calmly. "Please tell me I'm hallucinating or that this is a dream," the human Bob pinched himself confirming that he had in fact gone mad. "I think we ought to go on a walk," frog Bob suggested.</p>
            <p>"So let me get this peculiar matter straight, You're me and I'm you but for some strange and quite frankly unapparent reason you are also a frog." The two Bobs were now sat together on a bench while the human Bob had a rather valid crash out. "Yep, basically I'm you but from another version of Charles Dickens's work." Said frog Bob, unfortunately this did not ease the mind of human Bob as he hadn't quite got the gist of not being real, "What- what do you mean? I-We're what?" Frog Bob nodded sympathetically, "I understand, it's hard to wrap your head around being a story and not a functioning person." Bob gaped at him, "On the upside you are one of the main characters so you're practically immortal." Unfortunately this statement was shrouded in irony as as frog Bob Cratchit uttered these words the human version of him fainted dead away, unable to grasp anymore of this newfound version of so called life. "Oops." Frog Bob said.</p>
