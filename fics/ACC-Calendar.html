        <!-- Day 1-->
        <div id="1">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 1 - Scrooge's undead love</b></h1>
            <p>Marley was dead: to begin with but luckily for Scrooge it didn't last long. </p>
            <p>Seven years after Scrooge lost his only friend, if Marley could be considered as such, he saw his face again in the knocker in his front door and then again merely minutes later in full ghost form. </p>
            <p>"How now! What do you want with me?" Scrooge cried immediately recognising the see-through spirit before him. "Much!" Scrooge shivered as Marley floated towards him - this couldn't be real - his partner was dead he remembered the cheap affair of his funeral and how he was the sole mourner. They conversed for a few minutes more, Scrooge called him "more gravy than grave" due to how delightfully edible he looked in his usual tight waistcoat. Scrooge noticed the chains Marley wore, troubled by them even as he thought of the pleasurable things he could use them for. "You are fettered. Tell me why?" Scrooge trembled, but no longer in fear but anticipation of what the evening might entail. Marley hovered towards him until they were nearly face to face explaining how he forged his own chains but Scrooge was distracted...</p>
            <p>"Have i been a naughty boy, Marley?" He interrupted the ghost's warning and Marley looked in surprise as his old partner pulled him closer by his chains, "Speak comfort to me, Jacob!" "I have none to give." Marley paused and licked his see-through lips, Scrooge bit down on his tongue to contain himself, Marley was so close now, "It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge."  Ebenezer was on his knees before him now "Marley-" he said breathlessly before pulling Marley the rest of the distance to meet his lips. It was as good as he had remembered, seven long years of isolation. Oh, the pain! The agony! But now here he was with Marley his undead partner. Their mouths met over and over, Scrooge moaned erotically as Marley's cold hands pulled his clothes off of him. How he had missed this! How had he lived without him! </p>
            <p>Once their clothes had been shed, Scrooge pulled the spirit on top of him, collapsing into his favourite arm chair (£1.99 off eBay - What a bargain) Marley moaned as he slipped his tongue into Scrooge's mouth and his dick into Scrooge's ass. As Marley fucked him raw, Scrooge felt the joy of Christmas spirit for the first time in seven years.</p>

        <!-- Day 2-->
        <div id="2">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 2 - Marley the Whore</b></h1>
            <p>Marley walked into his regular gay bar on Dickens Street; ordered his regular drink, a vodka soda; walked over to his usual booth, where he found a grumpy looking tart he had never seen before; sat down and checked out the guy before him. He was new, Marley knew everyone who came here (he had fucked most of the men (Marley was a whore)) the guy across from him was currently glaring, which was only turning Marley on more. </p>
            <p>"Who are you?" Marley asked the man before him. "My name is Ebenezer Scrooge." "What are you a fucking victorian or some shit?" Marley looked at him again, he did look a bit old (just how he liked them), "My name's Jacob Marley, the local whore." He smirked at Ebenezer, who only glared at him in return, "My partner died. I only came here to get shitfaced for as little money as possible." Oh fuck Marley thought - he was dealing with a widow he had to change tactics.</p>
            <p>Marley slid his leg against Scrooges under the table, licking his lips as he did so, trying to gage his reaction. Scrooge frowned yet didn't pull his leg away, in-fact he pushed it closer towards Marley - that horny old bastard Marley thought. "I'm going to the bathroom-" Marley glanced at Scrooge as he stood up hoping he would get the hint, before walking away without looking back. </p>
            <p>The door banged shut behind Marley and before he could even turn around it was opening again, he was grabbed and pinned to a wall in the nearest bathroom stall by a flustered looking Scrooge. "You're going to owe me a drink after this." Scrooge growled, "I don't do things for free."</p>

        <div id="4">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 4 - I'm not straight, I mean gay.</b></h1>
            <p>Scrooge sat in the darkness, as he liked it. Darkness was cheap and he was the biggest cheapskate on the planet, he ate gruel to save money and he lived with his business partner because it meant more business profits, definitely not because he was in love with him. Scrooge couldn't be gay, of course he wasn't, he had a fiancée long ago and now he didn't love anyone but Marley money. Scrooge shifted in his chair (£1.99 off eBay) his thoughts made him uncomfortable, but secrets were spilled and everything became more believable after midnight. Scrooge needed to clear his head, it was Christmas Eve - his most hated holiday - and now he was having a sexuality crisis, he couldn't cope with sleeping in the same bed as his 'business' partner tonight.</p>
            <p>Closing the door behind him, Scrooge walked out onto the freezing street, his shoes clicked on the pavement as the beggars lining the street shifted uncomfortably away from him. Scrooge didn't feel powerful or rich only miserable and gay, in his mind he was as bad as his clerk or the pathetic peasants who went about with a Merry Christmas on their lips. Christmas his ass, "Bah" he said aloud startling the family sleeping in the alley beside him, "Humbug." Humbug to Christmas and homosexuality and wanting to sleep with his partner. Scrooge was done.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Day 20 - A very Merry Pride</b></h1>
            <p>Fred walked gaily along the street to his usual gay bar whistling merrily. As he entered he was greeted by his usual fuck drinking buddies yet he also spotted something or rather someone else. He grinned, he would recognise that surly figure anywhere, and strode over to him, "A Very Merry Pride, Uncle Scrooge." Fred's friends crowded around the two of them shocked at how two very different people could possibly be related. "Bah." Was Scrooges reply, "Nonsense. There is no 'merry' anything, nephew." "But uncle why are you here, are you... gay?" Scrooge coughed and stood up slowly, "Good afternoon." As he turned to leave Fred pulled him back, "Uncle Scrooge, please do stay, I never meant to offend you I was only questioning your purpose here." He paused, inviting Scrooge to tell him his purpose, Scrooge just glared at him, "Fine uncle don't explain to the people who could help you, anyway how about you come to my house tomorrow, my wife and I are having a party." Scrooge merely said "Good afternoon." Fred tried to object, "Uncle-" "Good Afternoon." </p>
            <p>A day later, Scrooge stood before his nephew's house seriously regretting his life, his old partner - Marley - had warned him once before of the dangers of the chains forged in life; maybe now was the time to break free.</p>
            <p>Fred jumped with glee when he saw his uncle enter his home, "UNCLE!" He yelled, runing over and throwing his arms around Scrooge. Scrooge was as responsive to the hug as a dead fish going through rigor morits. Fred's wife joined them, "Ebenezer, I'm surprised you came?" She said glancing suspiciously at Scrooge who cleared his throat, "I have something to confess dearest nephew." Scrooge paused for dramatic effect like the extra little shit he was, "I'm bisexual."  </p>
            <p>"Same. But no shit Sherlock." Said Fred, "My gaydar isn't that bad." "Well now you know." Scrooge said simply and left leaving an astonished Fred and his wife behind him. "Well I never would have suspected that." Fred's wife muttered. "He reminds me of myself when I used to be a girl." Fred said smiling as he saw Scrooge's shadow disappear into the distance.</p>
