    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Jerry sat motionless in his hutch, slowly chewing a piece of grass. He looked almost emotionless, and somehow peaceful. But no-one would ever know what he really thought. (Because he was a gerbil, and gerbils can’t talk).</p><p>“These humans think they’re so smart. They think that they’re the only species that can comprehend their own impending doom. But what I do know is… </p><p>When that stupid human puts disinfectant in your water, you know about it. And what’s more, I can’t even tell them apart so I know which one to bite - They all look the same“.</p><p> </p><p>Once Jerry had finished being racist, he got out of bed and had breakfast - “Random Grass”. He went for the water, but realising that it was disinfectant, spilled it.</p><p> </p><p>It sizzled on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh crap. That’s in my stomach”, he thought.</p><p>Jerry didn't have long to think about his fate, as in this moment Stephe (pronounced “Steve”) woke up. Stephe had got out of bed and had started eating his “Random Grass”.</p><p> </p><p>Jerry sighed. He was going to spend the last of his days locked up with this loon. But suddenly, he had an idea - what if he just - didn’t? He quite literally had fire in his heart, and he was going to prove it.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p>Jerry excitedly looked through his “Random Grass” until he found what he was looking for - a stick. In a frenzy, he wedged it into the clasp and it popped apart, leaving the hatch wide open.</p><p>He sat back, pleased with his work. And now, he would make the humans pay.</p>

  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was 4:23 am, and all was still. Birds were singing, humans were snoring, and Stephen’s brain was slowly rotting.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“So you want ME, to come with you, LEAVE the hutch and annoy the huge gerbils that give us food? I mean, where will I get my “Random Grass” from?”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“OUTSIDE!” screamed Jerry.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stephe was practically shaking as he said this, nervous of Jerry’s response: “But.. What is outside?”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Well Stephe, it’s like a huge hutch, where “Random Grass” grows from the ground - You can pick as much of it as you want. And, it won’t have sticks in it.”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stephe’s brow furrowed, deep in concentration. Eventually, he said “So, you<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>want ME to come with you, leave the hutch and annoy the huge gerbils that bring us food, all so that I can eat “Random Grass” without the random? AND, I have to pick it myself?”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If gerbils could facepalm, this one would have smashed his skull in. Still, he needed Stephe, as a counterweight (he was very fat).</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Fine, Stephe. I’ll just go and eat all of the Cheerios myself.”</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stephe immediately leapt to his feet, drooling. As Jerry said, if you were going to be an idiot, at least be a gullible one.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Right. Let’s do this.”</span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jerry’s plan was simple: leave the hutch, get Cheerios and then cause havoc. So simple in fact, that it only took 6 hours to explain it to Stephe. He particularly struggled with the concept of “descending”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(He has been in a hutch his whole life). “Leaving” was also hard for him.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And so, at 10:37, they found themselves peering out of the hatch, ready to jump. Stephe, however, was having second thoughts (of his life, the first was earlier). He was having trouble comprehending the 5cm drop, and was of the firm belief that ground could not exist without straw.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jerry was devastated - had the past 6 hours been for nothing? He contemplated leaving Stephe behind, but he really needed that counterweight.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was interrupted by a series of deafening (and painful-sounding) thumps, as a human finally decided to get up, and had fallen down the stairs.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jerry knew that he had to act fast - The human would surely notice that their hatch was wide open. He threw himself out of it, shouting “for Cheerios!” as he did so. But to the gerbil’s surprise, Stephe had followed him! Jerry closed the hatch behind them and they scampered around the house, jumping on tables and chairs until they reached the kitchen counter, where a box of Cheerios sat waiting for them.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">They dived in, and over the course of the next ten minutes, ate all of the Cheerios, (it was an extra large box), the plastic bag and the cardboard box.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">They sat, contented, on the kitchen counter. Stephe, who had eaten two thirds of the Cheerios, was violently sick on the floor. They watched on with delight as a human slipped on it (It didn’t notice the two gerbils laughing).</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I have to say, Jerry. That was pretty fun. We should do this again tomorrow”.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Jerry had bigger plans for tomorrow. Much bigger.</span></p>
