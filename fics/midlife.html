    <h1>The midlife crisis</h1>
    <p>As he read the Latin phrase “ego sum amere te” the sunlight framed his face perfectly highlighting his stunning features making my face flush. But he knew that it could never be James had made his feelings on homosexuality clear, besides he had a crush on a girl. Unless… but no, I couldn’t. I just wish I was her. She is perfect with her long dark hair and her deep brown eyes she’s so conveniently attractive, not like me I’m so ugly. He’d never like me and my brains accepted that but my heart and cock still ache for him all the time. </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
    <p>I nailed the pronunciation of that phrase cause I am perfect obviously. Is that a hint of blush on his cheeks? No it couldn’t be, that’s just wishful thinking on my part. Anyways I shouldn’t like him, I can’t like him it’s wrong and against god. He’s taken off his glasses to clean them, god why does that make him look even hotter. Anyways back to the Latin, but I can’t concentrate he just looks so hot and it seems he can’t concentrate either </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
    <p>I tried to concentrate on the work but he’s just so alluring. I couldn’t stop myself from staring and I think he noticed. Oh god, he can tell. Will this ruin our friendship forever? No, that can’t happen I need him in my life. I want to be with him, forever.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
    <p>She hates me, this was my chance to be normal. My chance to be redeemed. But no she doesn’t like me, how??? I’m perfect.  How am i ever gonna be loved by another female after this. She insulted my teeth. I want to die. I go to the Latin classroom and call Dylaln my only friend, to say goodbye. </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
    <p>I was just about to go to sleep but then my phone rang. It was Him. James. My love. I answer immediately. I hear his voice over the phone it’s shakey, he sounds like he’s been crying “h-hey how are you?”</p>
    <p>“I’m good” I reply. </p>
    <p>“I-I need to tell you something. I’m going to defenestrate myself I can’t live with the social embarrassment and if she doesn’t love me, who will? I want to die.” I’m gobsmacked. </p>
    <p>“No you can’t!” I declare involuntarily.</p>
    <p>“I need you!” Wait why did I say that, he can’t know. But he does. </p>
    <p>“What?” He replies. </p>
    <p>“You what?” I don’t care anymore </p>
    <p>“I love you James” I declare </p>
    <p>“and I have for years.” </p>
    <p>“R-really? I-I I think I love you too Dylaln.” “Please don’t defenstrate yourself. You should come to my house.” </p>
    <p>“But it’s against god.”</p>
    <p>“No it’s not James we can work through this together. Just come over and we can talk.” </p>
    <p>“Okay fine I’m coming.”</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
    <p>I ran the very long distance from the Latin classroom to his house. I was out of breath instantly but I kept going. It angers me that I know that he can run, quicker and for longer than me!</p>
