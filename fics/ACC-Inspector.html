      <p><b>[4/4, like 10 sharps or something]</b></p><p><span>Scrooge was a cold guy - he was in fact zero degrees kelvin. No wintry breeze could chill him, and no summerly rays of sun could warm him (very much). Anyone walking by Scrooge would get the strange feeling that someone very cold had just walked past them. The cold,</span></p><p><span>however, seemed to have infected his brain such that the only emotion he could express was coldness.</span></p><p><span>Scrooge sat in his office, cold. He had given up on coal, not even that could warm him up. His cold was interrupted by a gentle knock at his door - it was his beloved nephew Fred.</span></p><p><span>“Good Afternoon, my dear Scrooge!”, he said, in that joyful way of his. “Good afternoon to you too”, said Scrooge. After this he felt a painful jolt, and he realised that his vocal cords had frozen again, damn things. So when Fred responded “My dear Scrooge, will you join me for a Merry Christmas feast”, all he could say was “Good afternoon to you too”. </span></p><p><span>“Oh, my dear Scrooge, why cannot you be merry? Surely you will reserve at least one day a year for festivities?”. “Good afternoon”, said Scrooge.</span></p><p><span>“But Scrooge! We have had no quarrel where I have been a party?”. “Good afternoon”, said Scrooge.</span></p><p><span>“Ah well then. Merry Christmas!”. “Good afternoon”, said Scrooge.</span></p><p><span>“And a Happy New Year!”. “Good afternoon”, said Scrooge.</span></p><p><span>All that Scrooge wanted to do was take his nephew into open arms, but all that would do is freeze him. Scrooge sat back in his frozen chair and thought with his frozen brain about his frozen life. At length, he decided to retire to bed</span></p>
